# PJS-Number-Functions-Prompt

## This is a prompt tasked by Founders and Coders where I create functions that accept numbers as arguments 

## I was given four instructions to write up functions that passed once they gave the correct results of number arguments. 

* Write a function which accepts two numbers as arguments. The function should return the sum of the two numbers.
* Write a function that accepts four arguments, each will be a number. The function should add the first two numbers together; add the third and fourth numbers; and return the result of multiplying both sums together.
*
