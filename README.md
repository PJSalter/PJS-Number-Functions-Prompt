# PJS-Number-Functions-Prompt

## This is a prompt tasked by Founders and Coders where I create functions that accept numbers as arguments.

## I was given instructions to write these functions that passed once they gave the correct results of numbered arguments. 

### This was fun to problem solve several different ways in writing these functions which included higher order function methods. :nerd_face:

### *I attempted ES5 and ES6 variations on writing the code*

# **Instructions for all my attempts for the prompt:**

- # **Sum of two numbers**
    - *Write a function which accepts two numbers as arguments. The function should return the sum of the two numbers.*

- # **Add and multiply**
    - *Write a function that accepts four arguments, each will be a number. The function should add the first two numbers together; add the third and fourth numbers; and return the result of multiplying both sums together.*

- # **Return larger**
    - *Write a function which accepts two numbers. The function should return the larger number.*

- # **Sum of elements**
    - *Write a function which accepts an array as an argument. Each item in the array will be a number. The function should add all the numbers in the array and return the result.*
