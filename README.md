# PJS-Number-Functions-Prompt

## This is a prompt tasked by Founders and Coders where I create functions that accept numbers as arguments 

## I was given four instructions to write up functions that passed once they gave the correct results of number arguments. 

- Sum of two numbers
    - Write a function which accepts two numbers as arguments. The function should return the sum of the two numbers.

- Add and multiply
    - Write a function that accepts four arguments, each will be a number. The function should add the first two numbers together; add the third and fourth numbers; and return the result of multiplying both sums together.

- Return larger
    - Write a function which accepts two numbers. The function should return the larger number.

- Sum of elements
    - Write a function which accepts an array as an argument. Each item in the array will be a number. The function should add all the numbers in the array and return the result.
